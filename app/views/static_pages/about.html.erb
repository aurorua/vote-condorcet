  Vote is for making decisions. Whether among friends, or collegues, finding consensus is often the best way to move forward. Voting is meant to aggregate preferences to find the optimal choice for the group. There are many methods of doing this, and they all have their pros and cons. They vary in levels of expressivity, and more expressive systems should be available for more involved voters. Among trustworthy friends, there are great methods to find the optimal choice. For more contentious elections, there are methods that resist strategy. We think that many methods may be better in different situations. Therefore we intend to provide different experiences for the user (checking boxes versus ranking lists versus scoring items). In each voting type, certain ways of counting are used to find the winner. We prioritize methods that accurately find the optimum in a way appropriate for groups of friends. Then we provide methods resistant to attempts to break the system.
